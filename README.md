# The program for tracking an object on the site

## Description
This program is made by me in the course work. It allows you to track one object of a certain color on the surface, which track two cameras. Plans to add support for more cameras, several objects, other ways to select an object and improve the graphical interface.

## Usage
In the folder with the video you need to put 2 video files from the cameras. After that, set the location of the cameras in the settings file and run the program. A more convenient way will be implemented ASAP.

## Dependencies
The program uses the OpenCV library to track an object on the surface. For the program to work, you need to install this library.
